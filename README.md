# SoccerAnalytics
 Due to the chaotic nature of soccer as an one of the invasive sports, machine learning analysis methods have become in a current challenge to decision-making based on scientific evidence. We would have wide range of challenges about team tactics, player's physical or mental maintenance as peaking, or balance of cost and performance as talent acquisitions, etc. In this section, we focus on team tactics based on tracking and event data.

 The pipeline of analytics are defined as below.
 
- Calibration of single or multiple sensors including a camera    
    no code as of today.
- Object Detection and Tracking
    A code using YOLO + StrongSort are considered.
- Data as camera coordinate analysis
    no code as of today, but it's not common process to have analysis by camera 
- Homography
    no code as of today.
- Ground positional data analysis
    A code using open tracking data are considered.
- Event data classification
    no code as of today.
- Event data analysis
    A code using simple logic using open tracking data are cnsidered.

When it comes to broadcast video analysis, the movie tells me a lot.
